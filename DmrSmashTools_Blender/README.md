  * Performs Remove Doubles, Flip Normals, and Mirror UV afterwards.

* **Bake Shape Keys**
  * Bakes shape keys into mesh.

* **Match Vertex**
  * Match positions, normals, or weights of selected objects' vertices to those of active object's vertices. 
  * Vertex match range is adjustable.

* **Correct Right Weights**
  * Syncs right side weights to left side's. 
  * Creates new vertex groups where needed. (If "LegL" exists but "LegR" doesn't, "LegR" will be created.)
